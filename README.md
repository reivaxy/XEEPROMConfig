# XEEPROMConfig
Store and Retrieve a data structure in EEPROM

Uses the EEPROM library for the ESP8266 within the Arduino Core:
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries

The XEEPROMConfigClass class from this library should be derived, to provide a custom data structure as well as custom default value settings.

This is originally developped for the Iotinator project. It's also my first cpp creation in over 20 years. Ouch. :)
